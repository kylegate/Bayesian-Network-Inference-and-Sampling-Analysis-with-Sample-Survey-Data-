# Bayesian-Network-Inference-and-Sampling-Analysis-with-Sample-Survey-Data-
Bayesian network analysis techniques applied to sample survey data for probabilistic modeling. The project demonstrates proficiency in Bayesian inference, including enumeration, elimination, and sampling methods.
**Overview**
This project demonstrates the application of Bayesian network analysis techniques to probabilistic modeling using sample survey data. We construct a Bayesian network with four attributes and employ Python to implement and evaluate various inference methods, including enumeration, elimination, and sampling. The goal is to gain insights into data patterns and compute probabilities based on specific evidence.
**Tools and Technologies**
Python: The primary language used to construct the Bayesian network and implement inference algorithms.
BayesNet Class: A class used to build and manipulate Bayesian networks.
Inference Techniques: Methods like enumeration, elimination, rejection sampling, likelihood weighting, and prior sampling.
**Results and Insights**
Through Bayesian network analysis, we can identify relationships among attributes and compute conditional probabilities based on given evidence. Using various inference techniques, we evaluate the best methods for deriving probabilistic outcomes. The project demonstrates the versatility of Bayesian networks in modeling real-world data and provides valuable insights into data-driven decision-making.
